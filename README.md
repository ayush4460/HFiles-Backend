# HFiles Medical Dashboard Backend API

This is the backend API for the Medical Record Dashboard, built with ASP.NET Core 8, Entity Framework Core, and MySQL. It handles user authentication, profile management, file uploads, and session-based authorization.


## üîß Local Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
‚Ä¢ git clone https://github.com/ayush4460/HFiles-Backend.git

### 2. Set Up MySQL Database
Create a database named medical_db in MySQL:

‚Ä¢ CREATE DATABASE medical_db;

Add the connection string to appsettings.json:

In appsettings.json, configure the connection string to connect to your local MySQL database:

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "server=localhost;port=3306;user=root;password=yourpassword;database=medical_db"
  }
}

Replace yourpassword with the actual password for your MySQL root user.

### 3. Run the App
‚Ä¢ dotnet restore

‚Ä¢ dotnet build

‚Ä¢ dotnet run

The API will be available at http://localhost:5138

### 4. Run Migrations
‚Ä¢ dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

‚Ä¢ dotnet ef database update

This will create the required tables in the medical_db database.
